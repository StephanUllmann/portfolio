Learn a bit of Go! It's an easy language compiling to fast programs.

## Syntax

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, Gopher!")
}
```

## Another Example

> BTW
>
> Bash works as well

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

## Introduction

I can link internally to [my conclusion](#conclusion) on the same page when writing Markdown.

## Conclusion

I can use the URL `https://example.com/page-1/#introduction` to navigate directly to my Introduction on the page.

The background color is #045d4a for light mode and #ffffff for dark mode.
